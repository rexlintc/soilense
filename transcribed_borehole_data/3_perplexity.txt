**Report Introduction**

Gentlemen:

In accordance with your request, this report presents the results of our soil and foundation investigation of the subject property. The purpose of this study was to supplement the existing subsurface data to provide recommendations for site development and foundation design.

Our study indicates the site is underlain by loose granular soils which are likely to experience some settlements under the proposed building loads. However, construction of the proposed warehouse and office building at the site is feasible using conventional type footings and slabs based on recompacted native soil or structural fill provided the settlements can be tolerated by the building and incorporated into the structural design.

The following sections describe the investigation and explain our recommendations in greater detail.

---

**Project Description**

This study concerns the construction of a 62,000 square foot concrete tilt-up warehouse with a connecting two-story office building as shown schematically on the Site Plan, Plate 1. Maximum wall loads are expected to be on the order of 3 kips per lineal foot, dead plus live load, with maximum column loads of 75 kips. Floor design loads are estimated to be 250 psf. The floor slab will be dock high, requiring about 4 feet of fill above the existing grade.

**Soil Classification Chart (Summary)**

- Major soil divisions and their USCS symbols are listed, such as:
  - GW: Well-graded gravels, gravel-sand mixtures, little or no fines
  - GP: Poorly-graded gravels, gravel-sand mixtures, little or no fines
  - GM: Silty gravels, gravel-sand-silt mixtures
  - GC: Clayey gravels, gravel-sand-clay mixtures
  - SW: Well-graded sands, gravelly sands, little or no fines
  - SP: Poorly-graded sands, gravelly sands, little or no fines
  - SM: Silty sands, sand-silt mixtures
  - SC: Clayey sands, sand-clay mixtures
  - ML: Inorganic silts and very fine sands, rock flour, silty or clayey fine sands or clayey silts with slight plasticity
  - CL: Inorganic clays of low to medium plasticity, gravelly clays, sandy clays, silty clays, lean clays
  - OL: Organic silts and organic silty clays of low plasticity
  - MH: Inorganic silts, micaceous or diatomaceous fine sandy or silty soils, elastic silts
  - CH: Inorganic clays of high plasticity, fat clays
  - OH: Organic clays of medium to high plasticity, organic silts
  - PT: Peat, muck, and other highly organic soils

- Additional notes:
  - Dual symbols are used to indicate borderline soil classifications.
  - The discussion in the text of this report is necessary for a proper understanding of the material presented in the attached logs.
