Sconzo, Architect\n13219 Northup Way\nBellevue, Washington 98005\nAttention:\nSubject:\nGentlemen:\nJune 14, 1979\n4401 4th Ave S.\n586907\nMr. Thomas Sconzo\nSoil and Foundation Investigation\nFourth Avenue South\nSeattle, Washington\nE-971\nIn accordance with your request this report presents the results of our\nsoil and foundation investigation of the subject property. The purpose of this\nstudy was to supplement the existing subsurface data to provide recommendations\nfor site development and foundation design.\nOur study indicates the site is underlain by loose granular soils which\nare likely to experience some settlements under the proposed building loads.\nHowever, construction of the proposed warehouse and office building at the site\nis feasible using conventional type footings and slabs based on recompacted\nnative soil or structural fill provided the settlements can be tolerated by the\nbuilding and incorporated into the structural design.\nThe following sections describe the investigation and explain our recom-\nmendations in greater detail.\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION\nThis study concerns the construction of a 62,000 square foot concrete\ntilt-up warehouse with a connecting two story office building as shown schemat-\nically on the Site Plan, Plate 1. Maximum wall loads are expected to be on the\norder of 3 kips per lineal foot, dead plus live load, with maximum column loads\nof 75 kips. Floor design loads are estimated to be 250 psf. The floor slab\nwill be dock high, requiring about 4 feet of fill above the existing grade.\n③"
